      <p>One quote I live by is, I can either watch it happen, or be a part of it. Creating has always been a passion of mine. My earlist memory of feeling the urge to build something goes back to when I was in elementery school during the Thanksgiving holiday. We were assignment a class project and had to build a small village. No instructions were give, do as you wish were the rules. I won't bore you with the details, but I showed up to class with five small houses, all with working lights and toy residents.</p>

      <p>This urge to create is still in me. I majored in Public Relations and Advertising form Depaul University, and have worked on national digital campaigns ever since. But, I need to do more, so I am currently enrolled at Northwestern University and currently learning all the skills needed to become a full stack web developer. What am I going to create next? Whatever it is, I won't be watching someone from the sidelines. I'll be a part of it. </p>
